# Node.js CRUD Server with MongoDB

## Overview

This repository contains a server application built with **Node.js** and **MongoDB** for performing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The server is designed to provide a foundational backend for applications requiring data storage and manipulation.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, providing robust features for building web and mobile applications.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, facilitating schema modeling and database interaction.
- **Cors**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing requests from different origins.
- **dotenv**: Module to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- **nodemon**: Utility that monitors for changes in the source code and automatically restarts the server.
